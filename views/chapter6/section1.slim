    h1 Ion Ghinoiu
    h4 Mapping a nation's soul
    p
      |In a small, 4th-floor, walk-up office in a late nineteenth century mansion that
        looks as though it last got a fresh coat of paint during the Communist era, Ion
        Ghinoiu has been quietly toiling away for more than 45 years on what could be
        considered a map of Romanian identity.
    p
      |Ghinoiu is one of several scholars toiling on a massive five-volume
        Ethnographic Atlas of Romania, an almost unbelievably comprehensive look at
        enduring customs and folklore of his native country. The atlases include maps
        recording the evolution of local traditions, beliefs and practices. To collect
        the information starting in the 1970s, Ghinoiu and numerous colleagues
        interviewed 18,000 rural Romanians in 536 villages across the country.
