        h2 Arcade Pascaniuc:
        h3 The last traditionalist
      p
        |Most mornings, Arcade Pascaniuc's days begin as they have for the last 69
          years, since he was seven years old, by keeping an 8,000-year tradition alive
          with his bare feet.
      p
        |In the back of his modest cottage in the remote northern Moldavian village of
          Marginea, he kneads clay with his feet until it is soft enough to be
          transferred to his potter's wheel. There, I watched him fashion it into pots,
          pitchers and cups. He works alone, and unless you stumbled across the small,
          rusted sign advertising his shop on the narrow lane where he lives, you would
          never know he was in business.
      p
        |"The pots I make,” he tells me proudly as he works, "are for people to make
          use of in their homes, and not to set by their windows.”

        |With his aged and gnarled hands he skillfully shapes a pot before my
          eyes. His pottery is unadorned. No painting, no colors, purely functional.
          Everything has a practical purpose. As he speaks softly while working, it's
          clear that to him this is the measure of something that will last.
      p
        |"It's been going on for a long time,” he says. "People used to eat from clay
          vessels before iron was known. I don't really know all the history behind it,
          but it's an old tradition, and I want to keep it as I learned it. I am working
          in the same way I used to 50 years ago.”
      p
        |He first learned the art of pottery from his father, who learned it from his
          and on and on.
      p
        |"For many generations my forefathers used to make pots,” he says.
      p
        |Each passed down both the necessary skills and the essential shapes he makes in
          his humble workshop. As I watch, he makes it look easy, but it clearly takes
          great skill to work the clay into the right shape, to shape a pot so it will be
          sturdy, appealing and useful, and to be fired in his backyard kiln so the pots
          bake without shattering.

        |It's a cloudy summer day as Pascaniuc demonstrates age-old
          techniques, passed down for generations, that allow him to make the
          time-honored designs Romanians still find useful in everyday life.
      p
        |"Now I'm making a pot we call ‘Old Lady,'” he explains, quickly shaping a block
          of clay, all the while spinning the potter's wheel with his bare feet.  He
          raises the sides and widens the opening with movements so practiced they seem
          nearly unconscious.
      p
        |"People bake cozonac (a traditional Romanian cake) on it.” The design, he
          explains, bakes very hot in the middle and creates a cavity in the cake. "When
          it comes out of the oven, it has a hole in it, and you can put (painted) eggs
          in it and bring it to church for Easter blessings.”
      p
        |Pascaniuc works alone and lives modestly with his wife in their cottage
          surrounded by vegetable fields and a small grove of fruit trees. Through both
          his dedication to his craft and in his determination to see that it remains a
          part of everyday life, he is the embodiment of a knowledge keeper.
      p
        |"I've known this clay for 76 |years,” he says, again with evident pride.
          "People still buy these pots.”
